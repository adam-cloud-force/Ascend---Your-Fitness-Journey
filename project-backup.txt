# Ascend Your Fitness Journey - Project Backup

## Project Structure
The project is a Next.js fitness application with the following structure:

/app
  /(auth)
    /login
      page.tsx - Login page with authentication
    /signup
      page.tsx - Signup page with form and Google auth
    /onboarding
      page.tsx - Multi-step onboarding process
    layout.tsx - Auth layout with rain and fog effects
  /(dashboard)
    /dashboard
      page.tsx - Main dashboard with stats and workout programs
    layout.tsx - Dashboard layout with visual effects

## Key Features
- Authentication (Email + Google Sign-in)
- Multi-step onboarding process
- Dashboard with:
  - Workout stats
  - Progress tracking
  - Workout programs
- Visual effects (rain and fog animations)

## Latest Deployment
Latest production URL: https://ascend-your-fitness-journey-mfpfe85og.vercel.app

## Known Issues to Fix
1. 404 errors after signup/login
2. Project structure needs reorganization (app directory should be at root)
3. Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json) need to be at root level

## Dependencies
- next: 14.1.0
- next-auth: ^4.24.5
- react: ^18.2.0
- react-dom: ^18.2.0
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS

## Next Steps
1. Fix routing by ensuring proper Next.js route group structure
2. Move configuration files to root level
3. Update Vercel deployment settings
4. Test authentication flow

## Important Files Backup
All key files are in the repository and deployed to Vercel. The main components are:
- Authentication pages in (auth) route group
- Dashboard pages in (dashboard) route group
- Layouts with visual effects
- Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, vercel.json)

Your work is safely stored in:
1. The local repository at C:\Users\addie\fitness-app-new
2. The Vercel deployment at https://ascend-your-fitness-journey-mfpfe85og.vercel.app
3. This backup file

When you're ready to continue, we can:
1. Fix the 404 routing issues
2. Properly organize the project structure
3. Complete any remaining features
